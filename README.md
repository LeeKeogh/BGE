For the assignment I think I will make general physics objects. Examples of these would be planes, hovercrafts, cars, wrecking balls etc.
I may even add animals if time permits. 
I will continuously add new and working objects until the assignment is complete.
I will also have them interacting with the physical world. E.g crash tests and the like.
If possibly I may add a life bar to the various vehicles and have them disappear or break apart once the life is drained.
Many different joints and power supplies will be used in this assignment.
I will also try to texture these objects.

Here are come very very poor sketches of a few examples.
